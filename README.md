# Task 6-Password Strength Evaluation

## Objective:
The goal of this task was to understand what makes a password strong or weak by testing different passwords using an online tool. This helps build awareness of secure password creation and defenses against attacks like brute-force and dictionary attacks.

## Tool Used:
[HowSecureIsMyPassword.net](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/)
  * Estimates how long it would take to crack a password.
  * Results vary based on password length, use of uppercase/lowercase, numbers, symbols, and randomness.

## What Was Done:
  * Tested multiple passwords of increasing complexity.
  * Analyzed how changes like adding symbols, numbers, or length affect crack time.
  * Documented results in a detailed PDF.
  * Summarized password best practices and common attack types.

## Topics Covered in Report:
  * Password complexity and randomness
  * Brute-force and dictionary attacks
  * Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
  * LinkedIn breach case study
  * Best practices for creating strong passwords
